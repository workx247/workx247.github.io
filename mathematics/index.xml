      <description>How did I get here? Some 20 years ago, when I was an undergraduate (CS) student, I was pretty fond of theoretical computer science, but I also secretly joined fellow students in their math classes, but also lead me to pursue mathematics laterâ€¦&#xA;During that time I usually earned some extra money as a tutor for theoretical CS and mathematics.&#xA;Back then I often observed that both students and teachers, struggled to explain the technique of the diagonal argument in a general sense.</description>
