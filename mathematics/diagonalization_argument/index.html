<p>Some 20 years ago, when I was an undergraduate (CS) student, I was pretty
fond of theoretical computer science, but I also secretly joined fellow

later&hellip;</p>
<p>During that time I usually earned some extra money as a tutor for
theoretical CS and mathematics.</p>
<p>Back then I often observed that both students and teachers, struggled
to explain the technique of the diagonal argument in a <em>general sense</em>.</p>
<p>Usually, most of the students were able to grasp the individual applications
of that technique, Cantors uncountability proof for \(\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}\),

or the halting problem - depending on the field of study of the

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>What I would like to show here on a more formal level, is what the <em>diagonal argument</em>
actually is, and how to use it in its usual or contrapositional form.</p>
<h3 id="the-diagonal-argument">The Diagonal Argument</h3>
<hr>
<p>Given a function \(f: I \rightarrow S\), a function \(P: I \times S \rightarrow T \),
which is more like a property, i.e. \(|T| \geq 2\) is the only necessary condition
for \(P\). The following holds</p>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{gather}
\exists s^* \in  S\ \forall i \in I: P(i, f(i)) \neq P(i, s^*) \\
\text{implies }f\ \text{ is not surjective.}
\end{gather}</span>
<hr>
<p>It might look much more complicated than it actually is. If $f$ is surjective,
then $S$ is the range of $f$, $S = f(I)$, and because of $s \in S$ some index
$i^*$ would then yield $f(i^*) = s^*$, thus $P(i^*, f(i^*)) = P(i^*, s^*)$
contradicting the construction of $P$.</p>
<p>The equivalent, contrapositional form is:</p>
<hr>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{gather}
\text{If } f \text{ is surjective, then:}\\
\quad \not\exists s^* \in  S\ \forall i \in I: P(i, f(i)) \neq P(i, s). 
\end{gather}</span>
<hr>
<p>We could formally negate the implication (for all \(s^*\) exists
an \(i\) sich that &hellip;) - but that is not the way the diagonal argument is
usually applied. Rather that non-existence is exploited to refute a certain
construction of $s^*$&hellip; which would also be my meta-theorem-like takeaway from
the formal lighting of the diagonal argument:</p>
<p>The two forms which I am aware of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <em>direct form</em> - the goal is to prove that no surjective \(f\) exists.<br>
You are able to construct that special element \(s^*\) which is not in the image of \(f\) by
exploiting the inner structure of the set \(S\) and the property \(P\) -
the P-in-equality usually provides the means to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>contrapositional form</em> - the goal is to contradict some construction for
\(s^*\):<br>
You already know, by some theorem, that a surjective \(f\) exists.
A construction of \(s^*\) then involves several steps
that are proven to be legitimate and one step which is, only <strong>by assumption</strong> \(A\),
legal/existent. By showing that
\(\forall i \in I: P(i, f(i)) \neq P(i, s^*)\) for the constructed/hypthetical
\(s^*\), you have contradicted \(f\) being surjective and thus proven the
construction to be invalid, and thus the assumption \(A\) to be wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li>The restriction that, in the constructino of \(s^*\), only one assumption
\(A\) is made, is crucial. If several steps in the construction of \(s^*\)
are questionable, your proven result is weak in the sense that your proof
doesn&rsquo;t show anymore, precisely, which step in the construction fails.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fun fact: As in any theorem we might use it to falsify any aspect if it by just making clear
that every other aspect of our proof / construction is valid. It might
be thinkable to use the diagonal argument to prove that \(|T| = 1\), but I can&rsquo;t
think of an application like that. If you are aware of such an example,
please let me know (but please give me some relevant citation, not an artificial, made-up example).
Also, the coincidence that $I$ is part of the domain of $f$ as
well as $P$ is, in my opinion, a rather &lsquo;practical&rsquo; destillate of its usual
applications - if preferred, a distinction could be made, see (**).</p>
<h2 id="the-classic-examples-of-how-to-apply-the-diagonal-argument">The classic examples of how to apply the diagonal argument</h2>
<h3 id="cantors-uncountability-proof-for-mathbbr_01">Cantors uncountability proof for \(\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}\)</h3>
<p>We want to prove that the set of real numbers in the closed interval $[0,1]$ is uncountable.
I.e. that any enumeration $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}$ is not surjective.</p>
<p>We are going to first prove that any enumeration into $\{0,1\}^N$, the
set of infinite 0-1-sequences, is not surjective,
and are then going to show that $\{0,1\}^N$ could be embedded (injective) into $\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}$.</p>
<ol>
<li>First step: showing $|\mathbb{N}| < |\{0,1\}^N|$</li>
<li>Second step: showing $|\{0,1\}^N| \leq |\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}|$
<ol>
<li>Thus obtaining $|\mathbb{N}| < |\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}|$</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: <br>
Suppose we got an arbitrary surjective enumeration
$f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow [0,1]^N $</p>
<p>For the reader, we relate to the symbols used in the diagonal theorem above:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(I \equiv \mathbb{N}\)</li>
<li>\(S \equiv \{0,1\}^N\)</li>
<li>\(T \equiv \{0,1\}\)</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The property \(P\) is defined by the i-th component of an element $s \in S$.</p>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{align}
P(i, s) = s_i\begin{cases}
1\\
0
\end{cases}
\end{align}</span>
<p>We see now, because the codomain $P$ is two-valued, we can always define a different i-th
component for our exceptional sequence $s^*$:</p>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{align}
s^*_i = 1 :\iff  0 = P(i,f(i)) = s_i \\
s^*_i = 0 :\iff  1 = P(i,f(i)) = s_i \\
\end{align}</span>
<p>Application of the diagonal argument then yields that $f$ is not surjective,
$f(\mathbb{N}) \subsetneq \{0,1\}^N$. Because $f$ was arbitrary, we have shown that
$N < [0,1]^N$</p>
<p>While a continued fraction like $0,111111... = 1$ in binary, it is not
in <em>decimal</em> representation, which will be the aforementioned
injective embedding:</p>
<p>Viewing the sequences in $\{0,1\}^N$ as decimal fractions, the first digit left
of the comma always being 0, and leaving aside all other digits from 2 to 9,
we have an injective embedding of
$\{0,1\}^N$ into $\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}$ (thank you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument#cite_note-12" rel="external" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>That finally yields the second inequality $\{0,1\}^N \leq \mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}$,
so $|N| < |\{0,1\}^N| \leq |\mathbb{R}_{[0,1]}|$. $\blacksquare$</p>
<h3 id="cantors-theorem-regarding-the-cardinality-of-power-sets">Cantors theorem regarding the cardinality of power sets</h3>
<p>The power set of a set $X$ is the set of all subsets of $X$, denoted by $\mathcal{P}(X)$.</p>
<p>As long as $X$ is finite, $|\mathcal{P}(X)| = 2^{|X|}$, which is kind of
clear and could be understood with a few examples, but for infinite sets
intuition might fail.</p>
<p>Again, trying to do good teaching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let $f$ be some mapping from $X$ to $\mathcal{P}(X)$.</li>
<li>We assume $f$ is onto $\mathcal{P}(X)$, and will refute just that by using the diagonal argument.</li>
<li>$ I \equiv X $</li>
<li>$ S \equiv \mathcal{P}(X)$
<ul>
<li>We will denote elements of $X$ by $x$, and elements of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ by $\underline{x}$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>$ T \equiv \{true,false\} $</li>
</ul>
<p>The property \(P\) is then defined via:</p>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{align}
P(x, \underline{x}) := x \in \underline{x}
\end{align}</span>
<p>That is, given some element $x \in X$, and some subset of $X$, which is
by itself an element of $\mathcal{P}(X)$ - that is $\underline{x} \in \mathcal{P}(X)$ -
the property $P$ is true if $x$ is an element of $\underline{x}$ and false
otherwise.</p>
<p>This hints a way to choose membership for all $x \in X$, and membership is what
defines a subset of $X$, thus an element of $\mathcal{P}(X)$.</p>
<p>We define our special element, $\underline{x}^*$, as follows:</p>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{align}
\forall x \in X: x \in \underline{x}^* :\iff x \notin f(x)
\end{align}</span>
<p>But that boils down to:</p>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{align}
\forall x \in X: P(x, \underline{x}^*) \neq P(x, f(x))
\end{align}</span>
<p>Which is, by the diagonal argument, a contradiction to the assumption that $f$ is surjective. $\blacksquare$</p>
<h3 id="the-halting-problem">The halting problem</h3>
<p>This topic is treated a little less formal (***), but doing differently would be
beyond scope.</p>
<p>The halting problem is the problem of determining, given a program and an input,
if that program will halt and yield some result, or run forever.</p>
<p>We will call such a fictional program <em>the test</em>, and it would be tremendously
useful to have such a program, because we could abort program execution before
&lsquo;accidentally&rsquo; running into an infinite loop.</p>
<p>Thinking about this from a philosophical perspective will soon run yield
contradictions, and for me this is part of my fascination for theoretical
computer science, especially since the non-existence of such a test isn&rsquo;t
mere &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo;, it is <em>just not existent</em>.</p>
<p>This has applications in static
program analysis (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13428" rel="external" target="_blank">type inference</a>, but was relevant
in understanding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_correspondence_problem" rel="external" target="_blank">PCP</a>,
and gives bounds on how far we can determine compliance of a program given a
certain specification.</p>
<p>One might argue that this is all pretty old stuff, but so is a lot of &lsquo;pure&rsquo; theory <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The basic knowledge needed to follow this example is that all programs and
also their inputs could be binary encoded, and that binary encoding boils down
to $\mathbb{N}$.</p>
<p>So, again, to connect to the inital symbols of the diagonal argument - this
time used in its contrapositional form:</p>
<ul>
<li>$A$ is the assumption that a test program $s'$ exists.</li>
<li>$I \equiv \mathbb{N}$, the set of all inputs</li>
<li>$S \equiv \mathbb{N}$, the set of all programs (**).</li>
<li>$f$ is the identity function on $\mathbb{N}$, $f(i)=i$, so we won&rsquo;t explicitly mention it.</li>
<li>$T \equiv \{halt,loop\}$.
<ul>
<li>$P(i,s)$ is the property that program $s$ terminates on input $i$.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>N.B.: we know that $f$ is surjective.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to understand that the assumption $A$ does not contradict the
existence of $P$, which is a property of any program that holds or does not hold -
no questions asked / no relevance
about how to algorithmically determine that. It is the existence of
an actual program $s'$ that does just that, which is in question.</p>
<p>Using the assumption $A$, the existence of a halting test $s'$, we could construct a program $s^*$ that behaves
different with regards to $P$ than any other program $s$.</p>
<p>That is, we call $s'$ as a &lsquo;subroutine&rsquo;, which is the informal part (***) I mentioned earlier,
and then decide to loop forever if the test yields &ldquo;halt&rdquo;, and we halt if the test
yields &ldquo;loop forever&rdquo; - something like that, assuming strings are just binary
input and could be mapped to natural numbers:</p>

<p>Mathematically, we would express that as:</p>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{align}
P(i, s^*) = \begin{cases}
halt & \text{if } P(i,i) = loop \\
loop & \text{if } P(i,i) = halt
\end{cases}
\end{align}</span>
<p>So, again, by construction:</p>
<span class="math align-center">\begin{align}
\forall i \in I: P(i, s^*) \neq P(i, i)
\end{align}</span>
<p>So, by the diagonalization argument, $f$ would not be surjective - but it is,
which contradicts the assumption $A$, the existence of a test program $s'$
which we used in the construction of $s^*$. $\blacksquare$</p>

<p>One of the main reasons for this blog is, that I see people wasting
their time on problems that have been solved a long time ago&hellip; <br>
like re-inventing their own context-free parsing - and after some weeks or months of work nobody
knew if that &lsquo;spec&rsquo; even yielded a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_context-free_grammar" rel="external" target="_blank">deterministic grammar</a> <br>
-&gt; Using some standard tools like ANLR, Bison or CUP would have saved them a lot of time. <br>
<br>
Another practical experience: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-range_multilateration" rel="external" target="_blank">TDOA location</a>
is a problem with non-unique
solutions (e.g. in 2D, given a 3-sensor-array).
With some disturbances in the signal a multi-sensor array might yield
non-unique solutions as well. These minimal solutions usually differ - but finding the &lsquo;best&rsquo;
one also means finding all of them, which is computationally expensive. <br>
Some people I got to know in my career found that out the hard way&hellip;&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
